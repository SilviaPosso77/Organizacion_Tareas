## Next Steps

1. **Test all functionality** thoroughly
2. **Add role-based permissions** (admin features)
3. **Implement calendar integration**
4. **Add file upload functionality**
5. **Implement real-time updates** with WebSockets
6. **Add export/import features**
7. **Implement advanced reporting**

## Known Issues

1. **API Endpoints**: Some endpoints may need backend implementation
2. **Real-time updates**: Currently using polling, could benefit from WebSockets
3. **File uploads**: Not yet implemented
4. **Advanced permissions**: Role-based access control needs expansion

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination**: Consider implementing for large task lists
2. **Caching**: Implement client-side caching for better performance
3. **Lazy loading**: For heavy components like statistics
4. **Image optimization**: For future file upload features
